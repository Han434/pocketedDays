                    <h3>Why created "Pocketed Days"?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I decided to develop this application while using Notion. What I want is I want to creat productivity software like notion as the chance is given by the class. However, I believe my limited knowledge and experience is something that is holding me to achieve that. That is the reason why I developed this application. Which at the moment, I can work on idea that I have and add to this application. I hope you find helpful using this.
