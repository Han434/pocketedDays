            <p>Your mind is for holding ideas not holding them" quoted by David Allen.
                I started to work much more effectively right after I get to familiar with the above quotation.
                With that being said something that help me with that is "Notion" an application which I started to use a while ago to record and track my assignments and my activities.
                But it is a bit hard for me to customized it to my like as it is too complex for me.

            <h3>To be honest, I still can't figure out how it works.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>That is one of the reason why I decide to develop an application that can do what I exactly want to manage my rush life.</li>
                <li>Another reason is that I would like to try to work on lots of different program processes and projects as I continue learning and practicing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although the application is only capable of recording financial records for now, task management as well as stock management will be joining in no time.</p>
