# Myo Min Han's Individual Project

## Problem Statement
"Your mind is for holding ideas not holding them" quoted by David Allen. 

Pocketed Days is a web application that is created to help business or individual to help with task based structure. The application is created with the foundation which is a backbone to hold more concept and services.
I decided to develop this application while using Notion. What I want is I want to creat productivity software like notion as the chance is given by the class. However, I believe my limited knowledge and experience is something that is holding me to achieve that. That is the reason why I developed this application. Which at the moment, I can work on idea that I have and add to this application. I hope you find helpful using this.

#### Although the application is only capable of recording financial records for now, task management as well as stock management will be joining in no time.
