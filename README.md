# Myo Min Han's Individual Project

## Problem Statement
"Your mind is for holding ideas not holding them" quoted by David Allen. 
I started to work much more effectively right after I get to familiar with the above quotation. 
With that being said something that help me with that is "Notion" an application which I started to use a while ago to record and track my assignments and my activities. 
But it is a bit hard for me to customized it to my like as it is too complex for me. 
### To be honest, I still can't figure out how it works.
* So, I am creating a task manager in the style of "Notion"with some particular customized options.
* Another reason is that I would like to try to work on lots of different program processes and projects as I continue learning and practicing.

#### Although the application is only capable of recording financial records for now, task management as well as stock management will be joining in no time.
